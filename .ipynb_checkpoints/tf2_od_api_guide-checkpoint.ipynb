    "# Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Many resources already exist that allow you to train your own object detector on custom data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [The official custom training guide from Google research](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_training_and_evaluation.md)\n",
    "    * Provides code snippets of how to run the scripts e.g. `model_main_tf2.py`\n",
    "    * But doesn't provide full guidance as to what to expect.\n",
    "    * There used to be a [custom training guide for the cats and dogs dataset](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/running_pets.md) for TF1, but in TF2, the Google team only provided a [few shot learning jupyter notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/colab_tutorials/eager_few_shot_od_training_tf2_colab.ipynb) (not complaining though).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Google is also generous enough to release pretrained models in the [TF2 Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md)\n",
    "    * So we can fine tune on small datasets in the order of thousands and still get near world class results. All hail transfer learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* This [unofficial tutorial](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on www.readthedocs.io is excellent for beginners, guiding us through every step, from data labelling to model configuration to training to model export and inference. Kudos to the creator!\n",
    "    * But I feel like many of the parts are too manual (`label_map.pbtxt` and `pipeline.config` creation) and can be automated since there is no variation in those steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, I found an [old colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cloud-annotations/google-colab-training/blob/master/object_detection.ipynb) which uses the TF1 OD API to train on Google Cloud PLatform.\n",
    "    * This was a goldmine, because it showed the usage of the internal utility functions that can be used to create `label_map.pbtxt` and `pipeline.config` very easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similarly, the [few shots learning](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/colab_tutorials/eager_few_shot_od_training_tf2_colab.ipynb) notebook demonstrated usage of a custom training loop and model creation, which is great for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lastly, if you have the patience to read through the [`/object_detection/` files and folders](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/), you can find hundreds of documentations written at the start of the functions."
